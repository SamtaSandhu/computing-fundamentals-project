## 🎮 How to Use the Visualizer

### Stack Operations
1. Click the **STACK (LIFO)** button
2. Enter a value in the input field
3. Click **PUSH** to add elements to the top
4. Click **POP** to remove elements from the top
5. Watch the visual animation and info panel update

### Queue Operations
1. Click the **QUEUE (FIFO)** button
2. Enter a value in the input field
3. Click **PUSH** to add elements to the rear
4. Click **POP** to remove elements from the front
5. Observe the FRONT and REAR pointers
